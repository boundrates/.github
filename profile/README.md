# Hi there, we're Bound ðŸ‘‹

### About Bound

Volatile currencies can really mess up a tech company's finances â€” especially in uncertain times. Bound helps tech companies discover, manage and report currency risk.

Currency risk is when a business earns revenue in one currency and has costs in another. When a business has currency risk, it can lose money when exchange rates move around. Millions of businesses globally face currency risk every day. 96% of the FTSE 500 have hedging programs in place to mitigate their foreign currency risk, while only 4% of SMEs in the UK do the same <sup>[[1]](https://www.bound.co/references)</sup>. Weâ€™re looking to help the other 96% of SMEs.

We are an enthusiastic team and have raised a +$17mm from investors behind companies like Wise (formerly TransferWise), Klarna, N26, Stash and Xero.
